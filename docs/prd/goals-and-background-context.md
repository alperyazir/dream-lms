# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable structured learning management for FlowBook ecosystem connecting schools, publishers, teachers, and students
- Provide teachers with tools to assign, monitor, and provide feedback on interactive FlowBook activities
- Give students a clear view of assignments, progress, and personalized feedback
- Allow publishers to control content access and distribution to schools/teachers
- Create a centralized platform for admin oversight of all users and data
- Make digital learning interactive, measurable, and enjoyable through activity-based classroom management

## Background Context

FlowBook has successfully transformed traditional books into interactive digital learning experiences with drag-and-drop activities, word
matching, quizzes, and puzzles. While FlowBook excels at delivering engaging content, teachers and schools need structured tools to manage
assignments, track student progress, and provide meaningful feedback at scale.

Dream LMS fills this gap by layering a complete learning management system over the FlowBook ecosystem. By integrating with Dream Central
Storage's existing book data and activity definitions, Dream LMS enables teachers to assign specific activities as homework, monitor performance
analytics, identify common mistakes, and deliver personalized feedback. Publishers gain control over content distribution, while administrators
can oversee the entire system. This transforms FlowBook from an individual learning tool into a comprehensive classroom management platform that
saves teachers time, keeps students motivated, and helps publishers distribute content securely.
