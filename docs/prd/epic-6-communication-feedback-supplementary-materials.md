# Epic 6: Communication, Feedback & Supplementary Materials

**Epic Goal:**

Enable rich communication between teachers and students through direct messaging, implement a comprehensive notification system for all users
(new assignments, approaching deadlines, received feedback), provide teachers with multiple feedback mechanisms (text comments, badges, emoji
reactions), and allow teachers to upload and share supplementary learning materials (PDFs, videos, web links). By the end of this epic, Dream LMS
 delivers a complete learning ecosystem where teachers can communicate effectively, provide personalized feedback, and enhance assignments with
additional resources.

## Story 6.1: Notification System Foundation
