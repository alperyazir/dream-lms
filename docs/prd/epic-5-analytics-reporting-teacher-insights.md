# Epic 5: Analytics, Reporting & Teacher Insights

**Epic Goal:**

Provide teachers with comprehensive performance analytics and reporting tools to understand student progress, identify learning gaps, and make
data-driven instructional decisions. Enable teachers to view individual student performance, class-wide statistics, error pattern analysis, and
configurable time-period reports (weekly, monthly, yearly). Students can view their own progress charts and learning history. By the end of this
epic, teachers have actionable insights to support their students effectively, and students can track their own growth.
