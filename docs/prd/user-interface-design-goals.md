# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Dream LMS shall provide a clean, intuitive interface that maintains visual and interaction consistency with the existing FlowBook application.
The platform prioritizes ease of use for teachers (who may have limited technical expertise) while keeping students engaged through familiar
activity patterns. Each user role receives a tailored dashboard experience optimized for their primary workflows: Admin focuses on oversight and
system management, Publishers manage content distribution, Teachers handle classroom operations, and Students access assignments and track
progress. The interface design emphasizes quick task completion, clear information hierarchy, and minimal clicks to achieve common goals.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Each user role sees a customized home screen with relevant actions and information
- **Dialog-Based Assignment Creation**: Teachers create assignments through guided modal dialogs: select book → choose activity → configure
settings (due date, time limit, recipients)
- **Real-Time Progress Visualization**: Charts and progress bars update live as students complete work
- **Contextual Actions**: Right-click or hover menus provide quick access to common operations (view report, message student, view details)
- **Notification-Driven Workflow**: Users are proactively alerted to items requiring attention (new assignments, pending feedback, approaching
deadlines)
- **Bulk Operations Support**: Multi-select checkboxes for batch actions (assign to multiple classes, message multiple students)
- **Responsive Data Tables**: Sortable, filterable lists for managing students, assignments, and reports
- **Modal-Based Detail Views**: Activity details, student profiles, and reports open in overlay modals to maintain context

## Core Screens and Views

1. **Login/Authentication Screen** - Universal entry point for all user roles
2. **Admin Dashboard** - System overview with user statistics, school management, and publisher oversight
3. **Publisher Dashboard** - Book catalog management and school/teacher assignment interface
4. **Teacher Dashboard** - Class overview, recent activity, upcoming deadlines, and quick-assign tools
5. **Teacher Class Management** - Student roster, bulk import interface, class settings
6. **Teacher Assignment Creator** - Book/activity browser with assignment configuration (due dates, time limits)
7. **Teacher Analytics View** - Performance charts, student reports, error pattern analysis
8. **Teacher Messaging Center** - Conversation threads with students, notification management
9. **Student Dashboard** - Assigned homework list, progress summary, recent feedback
10. **Student Activity Player** - Interactive activity interface (consistent with FlowBook)
11. **Student Progress View** - Personal performance charts and learning history
12. **Shared Notification Center** - Unified notification panel for all user roles
13. **Materials Library** - Teacher upload/management and student access to supplementary content

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Dream LMS shall meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure usability for students and teachers with disabilities. This includes keyboard
navigation support, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast ratios, resizable text, and alternative text for all meaningful
images. Interactive activities inherited from FlowBook shall be evaluated and enhanced for accessibility compliance.

## Branding

The platform shall adopt a professional educational aesthetic with a warm, approachable color palette that appeals to both teachers and students.
 Visual design should feel modern but not overly playful (balancing K-12 engagement with professional credibility). Consistency with FlowBook's
existing visual language is essential for brand recognition and ease of adoption. The interface shall use clear iconography, readable typography
(minimum 14px body text), and adequate whitespace to reduce cognitive load.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Dream LMS shall be delivered as a responsive web application accessible via modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) on desktop, tablet,
and mobile devices. The interface shall adapt gracefully across screen sizes:

- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Full feature set with multi-column layouts and advanced data tables
- **Tablet (768px-1023px)**: Optimized for touch with simplified navigation and stacked layouts
- **Mobile (320px-767px)**: Essential workflows only (student activity completion, teacher quick feedback, notifications)

Native mobile app development is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for MVP but may be considered for future phases based on user feedback and adoption
metrics.
