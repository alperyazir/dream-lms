# Conclusion

This architecture document provides a comprehensive blueprint for building Dream LMS. The design prioritizes **pragmatic simplicity for MVP** while maintaining **clear boundaries for future scaling**. Key highlights:

- **Monolithic FastAPI backend** with clean service layers for future microservices extraction
- **PostgreSQL database** with optimized indexes for analytics workloads
- **React SPA frontend** with modern state management (TanStack Query + Zustand)
- **MinIO integration** via pre-signed URLs for secure, direct browser access
- **JWT authentication** with role-based access control
- **Docker Compose deployment** on single VPS, scalable to Kubernetes

**Next Steps:**
1. Review with development team
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Establish sprint planning cadence

**Questions or Clarifications Needed:**
- Dream Central Storage API documentation (endpoints, authentication)
- Existing book catalog size (for initial sync planning)
- Peak concurrent user estimate (for capacity planning)
