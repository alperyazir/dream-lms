    title: 'Rate limiting not implemented'
    description: 'Story mentions rate limiting (10/min) but not implemented in endpoints. File uploads are resource-intensive and should be rate-limited.'

    description: 'Temporary passwords returned in API response body. While acceptable for temp passwords, consider alternative delivery (email, secure download) for production.'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'RBAC implemented correctly, file validation good, but missing rate limiting and credentials in plaintext response are concerns. No input sanitization for Excel cell values.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Efficient batch database checks, read-only Excel parsing. Minor inefficiency with double file read.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent transaction handling with rollback, comprehensive error handling with detailed messages.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Well-structured with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive type hints, good documentation, 30 tests covering utilities and endpoints.'

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Implement rate limiting on bulk import endpoints (10/min as specified)'
      refs: ['backend/app/api/routes/teachers.py', 'backend/app/api/routes/admin.py']
    - action: 'Add input sanitization for Excel cell values to prevent potential injection'
      refs: ['backend/app/utils.py:185-236']

  future:
    - action: 'Consider alternative credential delivery (email/secure download) instead of HTTP response'
      refs: ['backend/app/api/routes/teachers.py:248-255']
    - action: 'Optimize file reading to avoid reading file twice'
      refs: ['backend/app/utils.py:150-164', 'backend/app/utils.py:185-236']
    - action: 'Use or remove unused Pydantic bulk import schemas'
      refs: ['backend/app/models.py:662-685']
    - action: 'Add school_id existence validation in teacher bulk import endpoint (like admin endpoint has)'
      refs: ['backend/app/api/routes/teachers.py:105-257']

strengths:
  - 'Excellent separation of concerns with services/bulk_import.py module'
  - 'Comprehensive validation with role-specific logic'
  - 'Atomic transaction handling with proper rollback'
  - 'Outstanding test coverage: 20 unit tests + 10 integration tests'
  - 'Proper RBAC implementation with require_role()'
  - 'Detailed error messages with row numbers for debugging'
  - 'Security: read_only=True prevents macro execution'
  - 'Type hints throughout codebase'
  - 'Logging for monitoring and debugging'
  - 'All 173 tests passing'
