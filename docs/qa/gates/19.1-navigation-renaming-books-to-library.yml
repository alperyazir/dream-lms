  summary: |
    Story 19.1 demonstrates perfect execution of a simple UI text standardization task.
    All 13 acceptance criteria have been met with surgical precision. The implementation
    correctly updates all navigation labels from "Books" to "Library" across Admin,
    Supervisor, Teacher, and Publisher views while preserving the Publisher's "My Library"
    branding. Routes are preserved to avoid breaking changes. No blockers, concerns, or
    follow-up work required.
