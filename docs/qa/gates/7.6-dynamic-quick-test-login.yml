    notes: 'Environment check prevents production exposure. 404 response hides endpoint. No sensitive data in response (username/email only).'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Simple query with .limit(5). Frontend caches forever (staleTime: Infinity). Minimal performance impact.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful error handling. Empty arrays for missing roles. No crashes on API failures. Retry disabled appropriately.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean implementation. Well-documented. Type-safe. Test coverage comprehensive. Minor docstring update recommended.'

  future:
    - action: 'Update backend docstring to remove "sorted by newest first" reference since sorting not implemented'
      refs: ['backend/app/api/routes/dev.py:18']
      severity: low
      rationale: 'Docstring mentions sorting but User model lacks created_at field. Dev acknowledged deviation. Low priority fix for dev-only endpoint.'
    - action: 'Consider adding created_at timestamp to User model for audit trails and proper temporal ordering'
      refs: ['backend/app/models.py']
      severity: low
      rationale: 'Would enable sorting in future. General model improvement, not specific to this feature.'
