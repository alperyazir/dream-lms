nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent RBAC implementation with require_role() dependency, proper data isolation enforced at query level, cryptographically secure password generation using secrets module, atomic transactions for user+role creation, duplicate email validation. Temporary passwords appropriately returned in response for one-time delivery."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient queries with proper use of SQLModel select/join patterns, pagination implemented with sensible defaults (limit=100), atomic transactions use flush/commit pattern to minimize lock time. No N+1 query issues detected."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Atomic transactions ensure data consistency (user + role record created together or not at all), proper error handling with specific HTTPExceptions, comprehensive test coverage including error scenarios and edge cases."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns (routes/CRUD/models), consistent naming conventions, proper type hints throughout, well-structured tests. Minor documentation improvements suggested but code is generally self-documenting."

# Overall Assessment
assessment: |
  Story 1.4 demonstrates excellent software engineering practices:

  STRENGTHS:
  • Comprehensive RBAC with proper separation between admin/publisher/teacher/student roles
  • Strong data isolation enforced at the query level prevents unauthorized data access
  • 26 passing tests with 100% acceptance criteria coverage
  • Atomic transactions ensure data consistency
  • Cryptographically secure password generation
  • Clean code architecture with proper separation of concerns
  • Standards-compliant implementation throughout
  • Excellent test design covering positive cases, negative cases, and edge cases

  MINOR IMPROVEMENTS (Non-blocking):
  • Add inline comments for complex queries (1 location)
  • Consider expanding route handler docstrings

  VERDICT: PASS - Ready for production deployment.
  This implementation sets a high bar for future stories. The attention to security,
  testing, and code quality is exemplary. The minor documentation suggestions are
  purely for enhanced maintainability and do not impact functionality or safety.
