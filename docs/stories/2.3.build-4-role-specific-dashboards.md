### Tech Stack

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Frontend Stack (Current):**
- **React** 18.x - UI library with concurrent features
- **Vite** 5.x - Build tool (fast dev server)
- **TypeScript** 5.x - Full type coverage required
- **Shadcn UI** (Latest) - Component library (Radix UI + Tailwind) ✅ INSTALLED
- **Tailwind CSS** 3.x - Utility-first CSS ✅ CONFIGURED
- **TanStack Query** 5.x - Server state management (keep as-is)
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing (keep as-is)
- **Recharts** 2.x - Data visualization for charts

**Key Principle for This Story:** Build UI with mock data only. No API calls. Use local mock data from `src/lib/mockData.ts`.

### Project Structure

[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**New Files to Create:**

```

**Existing Files to Modify:**

```
frontend/src/
├── router.tsx                      # Add 4 new dashboard routes
└── components/Common/
    └── SidebarItems.tsx            # Verify dashboard links exist (likely already there)
```

**File Naming Conventions:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#key-naming-conventions]
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `StatCard.tsx`)
- Pages: lowercase with underscores in routes (e.g., `dashboard.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with "use" prefix (e.g., `useCountdown.ts`)

### Routing & Protected Routes

[Source: docs/architecture/5-frontend-architecture.md#53-routing--protected-routes]

**TanStack Router Pattern:**
This project uses TanStack Router. Dashboard pages should be placed in `frontend/src/routes/_layout/<role>/dashboard.tsx`.

**Protected Routes:**
The template already has ProtectedRoute wrapper. These dashboard pages are nested under `_layout` which is protected.

**Role-Based Guards:**
Sidebar already implements role-based menu visibility (Story 2.1 + 2.2). Each role should only see their own dashboard link.

**Route Structure:**
```
/admin/dashboard    → AdminDashboard (role: admin)
/publisher/dashboard → PublisherDashboard (role: publisher)
/teacher/dashboard  → TeacherDashboard (role: teacher)
/student/dashboard  → StudentDashboard (role: student)
```

### Coding Standards

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**TypeScript Component Pattern:**

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Typed props, clear structure, exported for testing
export interface StatCardProps {
  icon: React.ReactNode
  label: string
  value: string | number
  trend?: {
    value: number
    direction: 'up' | 'down'
  }
}

export function StatCard({ icon, label, value, trend }: StatCardProps) {
  return (
    <Card className="shadow-neuro">
      {/* Implementation */}
    </Card>
  )
}
```

**Import Patterns:**
```typescript
// Shadcn UI components
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from '@/components/ui/card'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge'

// Recharts
import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts'

// Mock data
import { adminDashboardData, teacherDashboardData } from '@/lib/mockData'
```

**Tailwind Class Organization:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

```tsx
// Order: Layout → Sizing → Spacing → Colors → Typography → Effects
<div className="flex flex-col items-center w-full p-4 bg-teal-500 text-white font-bold shadow-neuro">
```

### Design System Tokens

[Source: Story 2.1 - Design System Configured]

**Dream LMS Colors:**
- Primary (Teal): `teal-50` through `teal-950`, main: `teal-500` (#14B8A6)
- Secondary (Cyan): `cyan-50` through `cyan-950`, main: `cyan-500` (#06B6D4)
- Gradients: Use `bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-500 to-cyan-500` for hero sections

**Neumorphic Shadows:**
- `shadow-neuro-sm` - Subtle depth (badges, small buttons)
- `shadow-neuro` - Standard depth (cards, containers)
- `shadow-neuro-lg` - Prominent depth (hero cards, modals)

**Usage Examples:**
```tsx
// Stat Card with neumorphic shadow
<Card className="shadow-neuro border-teal-100 hover:shadow-neuro-lg transition-shadow">

// Header with gradient
<CardHeader className="bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-500 to-cyan-500 text-white">

// Badge with subtle shadow
<Badge className="bg-teal-500 text-white shadow-neuro-sm">
```

### Recharts Integration

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Recharts 2.x is available for data visualization.**

**Common Chart Patterns:**

```typescript
// LineChart example (User Growth, Progress)
<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
  <LineChart data={mockData}>
    <XAxis dataKey="month" />
    <YAxis />
    <Tooltip />
    <Line type="monotone" dataKey="value" stroke="#14B8A6" strokeWidth={2} />
  </LineChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>

// BarChart example (Activity by Type, Class Performance)
<ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
  <BarChart data={mockData}>
    <XAxis dataKey="name" />
    <YAxis />
    <Tooltip />
    <Bar dataKey="value" fill="#06B6D4" />
  </BarChart>
</ResponsiveContainer>
```

**Chart Styling:**
- Use Teal (#14B8A6) and Cyan (#06B6D4) for chart colors
- Wrap charts in `<Card className="shadow-neuro">` for consistency
- Ensure dark mode support (Recharts inherits CSS variable colors)

### Mock Data Structure

**No specific guidance found in architecture docs.**

**Recommendation:** Create a well-typed mock data file at `frontend/src/lib/mockData.ts` with clear interfaces:

```typescript
// Example structure
export interface AdminStats {
  totalUsers: number
  activeSchools: number
  totalAssignments: number
}

export interface ActivityFeedItem {
  id: string
  user: string
  action: string
  timestamp: string
}

export const adminDashboardData = {
  stats: { totalUsers: 432, activeSchools: 12, totalAssignments: 1245 },
  activityFeed: [/* ... */],
  userGrowth: [/* chart data */],
  activityByType: [/* chart data */]
}

// Similar structures for publisher, teacher, student
```

### Countdown Timer Implementation

**No specific guidance found in architecture docs.**

**Recommendation:** Use React hooks for countdown:

```typescript
// hooks/useCountdown.ts
export function useCountdown(dueDate: string) {
  const [timeLeft, setTimeLeft] = useState<string>('')

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      const now = new Date().getTime()
      const due = new Date(dueDate).getTime()
      const diff = due - now

      if (diff <= 0) {
        setTimeLeft('Past Due')
        clearInterval(interval)
        return
      }

      const days = Math.floor(diff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24))
      const hours = Math.floor((diff % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60))
      const minutes = Math.floor((diff % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60))

      setTimeLeft(`${days}d ${hours}h ${minutes}m`)
    }, 1000)

    return () => clearInterval(interval)
  }, [dueDate])

  return timeLeft
}
```

### State Management

[Source: docs/architecture/5-frontend-architecture.md#52-state-management]

**For This Story:**
- **NO API calls** - All data is local mock data
- **NO TanStack Query** needed for this story (will be used in later epics)
- **Simple React state** for UI interactions (e.g., countdown timers)

**Later Stories (Epics 3-6):** Will replace mock data with TanStack Query hooks calling real APIs.

### Dark Mode Support

[Source: Story 2.2 - Dark mode working]

**Theme System:**
- Theme provider: `next-themes` (already configured)
- CSS variables configured in `frontend/src/index.css`
- All Shadcn components support dark mode automatically

**Testing Dark Mode:**
- Toggle theme using ColorModeToggle component in Navbar
- Verify all stat cards, charts, badges render correctly in both modes
- Ensure text contrast is readable (especially on gradients)

### Responsive Design

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Tailwind Responsive Utilities:**

```tsx
// Stack cards on mobile, grid on desktop
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">

// Hide sidebar on mobile
<div className="hidden md:block">

// Responsive text sizes
<h1 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl">
```

**Breakpoints:**
- `sm`: 640px
- `md`: 768px
- `lg`: 1024px
- `xl`: 1280px
- `2xl`: 1536px

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/10-testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Strategy for This Story:**

**Component Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library):**
- Test file location: Collocate with source files (e.g., `StatCard.test.tsx`)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall: GOOD** - Implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with excellent TypeScript typing, clean component architecture, and consistent design system application. The code is well-organized, properly structured, and follows React best practices. However, the story would benefit from test coverage and accessibility improvements before being marked as Done.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Excellent TypeScript usage with comprehensive interface definitions in `mockData.ts`
- ✅ Clean component design with proper props typing and separation of concerns
- ✅ Reusable component library (10 dashboard components created)
- ✅ Neumorphic design system consistently applied throughout
- ✅ Responsive grid layouts with appropriate Tailwind breakpoints
- ✅ Dark mode support implemented correctly
- ✅ Custom `useCountdown` hook is well-implemented with proper cleanup
- ✅ Role-based navigation working correctly with active state highlighting

**Areas for Improvement:**
- ⚠️ Zero automated tests despite 16 new files and critical countdown functionality
- ⚠️ Missing accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- ⚠️ No error boundaries to prevent cascading failures
- ⚠️ Hardcoded dates in mock data may appear outdated

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review. The code quality is sufficient and the story is focused on UI implementation with mock data. Refactoring was deemed unnecessary at this stage.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✓ PASS
  - TypeScript properly typed throughout
  - Component naming follows PascalCase convention
  - Import organization follows documented patterns
  - Tailwind class organization is logical (layout → sizing → spacing → colors → effects)

- **Project Structure:** ✓ PASS
  - Dashboard routes correctly placed in `frontend/src/routes/_layout/<role>/dashboard.tsx`
  - Components organized in `frontend/src/components/dashboard/`
  - Mock data centralized in `frontend/src/lib/mockData.ts`
  - Hooks in `frontend/src/hooks/` directory

- **Testing Strategy:** ✗ CONCERNS
  - Story marked tests as optional, but for 16 new files this is risky
  - No tests for critical countdown timer functionality
  - No tests for dashboard rendering
  - Recommendation: Add at least basic component tests before integration

- **All ACs Met:** ✓ PASS
  - AC1 (Admin Dashboard): ✓ Stats cards, activity feed, quick actions, charts implemented
  - AC2 (Publisher Dashboard): ✓ Schools grid, books grid, stats, quick actions implemented
  - AC3 (Teacher Dashboard): ✓ Classes, assignments, deadlines, quick actions, charts implemented
  - AC4 (Student Dashboard): ✓ Assignments due with countdown, progress chart, feedback, achievements implemented
  - AC5 (Neumorphic design): ✓ Shadow classes and gradients consistently applied
  - AC6 (Mock data): ✓ All data from `mockData.ts`, no API calls
  - AC7 (Responsive): ✓ Grid systems adapt to screen sizes

### Requirements Traceability

**Given-When-Then Mapping:**

**AC1: Admin Dashboard**
- **Given** an admin user logs in
- **When** they navigate to /admin/dashboard
- **Then** they see system stats (432 users, 12 schools, 1,245 assignments), activity feed, and charts
- **Coverage:** ✓ Implemented (manual testing only)

**AC2: Publisher Dashboard**
- **Given** a publisher user logs in
- **When** they navigate to /publisher/dashboard
- **Then** they see their schools (5), books (8), and teacher stats (23)
- **Coverage:** ✓ Implemented (manual testing only)

**AC3: Teacher Dashboard**
- **Given** a teacher user logs in
- **When** they navigate to /teacher/dashboard
- **Then** they see their classes (3), assignments (5 with completion rates), deadlines, and performance charts
- **Coverage:** ✓ Implemented (manual testing only)

**AC4: Student Dashboard**
- **Given** a student user logs in
- **When** they navigate to /student/dashboard
- **Then** they see assignments due with live countdown timers, progress chart, feedback, and achievements
- **Coverage:** ✓ Implemented (manual testing only)

**AC5: Neumorphic Design**
- **Given** any dashboard is rendered
- **When** viewed in light or dark mode
- **Then** cards display neumorphic shadows and teal/cyan gradients
- **Coverage:** ✓ Implemented (visual QA only)

**AC6: Mock Data Only**
- **Given** any dashboard loads
- **When** data is displayed
- **Then** all data comes from `mockData.ts` with no API calls
- **Coverage:** ✓ Verified in code review

**AC7: Responsive Design**
- **Given** any dashboard is viewed
- **When** screen size changes (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- **Then** layouts adapt using Tailwind grid utilities
- **Coverage:** ✓ Implemented (visual QA needed)

**Test Coverage Gap:** All acceptance criteria rely on manual testing only. Automated tests would improve confidence.

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - No security concerns identified.

**Findings:**
- UI-only story with mock data
- No authentication logic modified
- No sensitive data handling
- No API endpoints exposed
- Role-based routing relies on existing authentication system

**Recommendation:** Security review not required for this story type.

### Performance Considerations

✓ **PASS** - No significant performance concerns.

**Findings:**
- **Charts:** Use `ResponsiveContainer` from Recharts for efficient rendering
- **Countdown Timers:** Update every 1 second using `setInterval` - acceptable for UI feedback
- **Component Rendering:** No unnecessary re-renders detected in code review
- **Bundle Size:** Large story but appropriate for dashboard UX

**Potential Optimizations (Future):**
- Consider `React.memo` for StatCard if parent re-renders frequently
- Lazy load dashboard routes with React.lazy() when integrating real API
- Consider debouncing countdown updates to every 5 seconds when > 1 hour remaining

**Gate:** CONCERNS → `docs/qa/gates/2.3-build-4-role-specific-dashboards.yml`

**Quality Score:** 70/100
- Deductions: -20 for missing tests, -10 for accessibility gaps

**Top Issues:**
1. **TEST-001** (Medium): No automated tests for 16 new files
2. **A11Y-001** (Medium): Missing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
3. **REL-001** (Medium): No error boundaries for graceful failure handling
4. **DATA-001** (Low): Hardcoded dates in mock data may appear stale

**NFR Assessment:**
- Security: PASS
- Performance: PASS
- Reliability: CONCERNS
- Maintainability: PASS

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Recommended - Address Medium Priority Items**

The implementation is solid and functional, but given the size of this story (16 new files, critical countdown functionality), the lack of any automated tests is concerning. Additionally, accessibility improvements would benefit future users.

**Recommendation:**
1. Add at least 2-3 basic unit tests (StatCard, useCountdown)
2. Add ARIA labels to stat cards
3. Consider error boundaries before integration with real API

**Alternative:** Team can accept CONCERNS gate and address items in future story if timeline is critical. The code is production-ready from a functionality perspective.

**Story owner decides final status based on project priorities.**

### Re-Review Date: 2025-10-28 (Post-Fix Verification)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Fix Verification Summary

**Result: APPROVED** ✅ - Development team successfully addressed 3 of 4 QA concerns with high-quality implementations. The one deferred item (TEST-001) is appropriately justified due to missing project-wide test infrastructure.

**Quality Score Improvement:** 70/100 → 90/100 (+20 points)

### Detailed Fix Assessment

#### 1. REL-001 (Error Boundaries) - ✅ RESOLVED

**Status:** EXCELLENT implementation

**What was done:**
- Created `ErrorBoundary.tsx` React class component in `frontend/src/components/Common/`
- Wrapped all 4 dashboard routes with ErrorBoundary HOC
- Implemented proper React error lifecycle methods

**Quality Review:**
```typescript
✅ getDerivedStateFromError() - Correct static method implementation
✅ componentDidCatch() - Proper error logging
✅ Fallback UI - User-friendly error card with retry/refresh options
✅ Error details - Collapsible error info for debugging
✅ Custom fallback support - Props allow custom fallback components
✅ Design consistency - Uses shadcn Card components with neumorphic styling
```

**Files Verified:**
- `frontend/src/components/Common/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (95 lines, well-documented)
- `frontend/src/routes/_layout/admin/dashboard.tsx:43-46` - Wrapped
- `frontend/src/routes/_layout/publisher/dashboard.tsx:14-17` - Wrapped
- `frontend/src/routes/_layout/teacher/dashboard.tsx:25-28` - Wrapped
- `frontend/src/routes/_layout/student/dashboard.tsx:21-25` - Wrapped

**Verdict:** Professional-grade error boundary implementation. Exceeds requirements.

#### 2. A11Y-001 (Accessibility) - ✅ RESOLVED

**Status:** EXCELLENT implementation

**What was done:**
- Enhanced StatCard with comprehensive ARIA attributes
- Enhanced AssignmentDueCard with timer-specific ARIA support
- Added proper semantic roles and live regions

**StatCard Accessibility Features:**
```typescript
✅ role="region" - Proper landmark role
✅ aria-label="{label} statistics card" - Context for screen readers
✅ id/aria-labelledby pattern - Associates label with value
✅ aria-live="polite" - Announces value changes
✅ role="status" on trend - Semantic role for status info
✅ aria-label on trend - Descriptive "increasing/decreasing by X percent"
✅ aria-hidden="true" on icons - Hides decorative elements
```

**AssignmentDueCard Accessibility Features:**
```typescript
✅ role="article" - Semantic document structure
✅ aria-label="Assignment: {name} for {subject}" - Card context
✅ role="timer" - Proper timer role
✅ aria-live="polite" - Announces countdown updates
✅ aria-atomic="true" - Reads entire timer on update
✅ Dynamic aria-label - Updates with time remaining
✅ aria-label on button - "Start assignment: {name}"
✅ aria-hidden="true" on icons - Reduces noise
```

**WCAG 2.1 Compliance:**
- ✅ 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A) - Semantic HTML and ARIA roles
- ✅ 4.1.3 Status Messages (Level AA) - aria-live regions for dynamic content
- ⚠️ 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A) - Interactive elements use default button/card behavior (assumed functional)

**Verdict:** Comprehensive accessibility implementation. Well beyond initial requirements.

#### 3. DATA-001 (Mock Data Dates) - ✅ RESOLVED

**Status:** EXCELLENT implementation

**What was done:**
- Created `getRelativeDate(daysOffset)` helper function
- Created `getRelativeDateTime(daysOffset, hours, minutes)` helper function
- Replaced all 36 hardcoded dates with relative calculations

**Helper Functions Quality:**
```typescript
✅ Well-documented with JSDoc comments
✅ Clean implementation using Date API
✅ Returns ISO format strings (compatible with existing code)
✅ Handles both date-only and datetime formats
✅ Default parameters (hours=23, minutes=59) for convenience
```

**Date Strategy:**
```typescript
✅ Publisher join dates: -320 to -45 days (realistic history)
✅ Assignment due dates: +7 to +12 days (near future)
✅ Score history: -23 to -1 days (recent past semester)
✅ Feedback dates: -6 to -1 days (very recent)
✅ Achievement dates: -16 to -1 days (recent achievements)
```

**Impact:**
- Mock data now always appears fresh and realistic
- No maintenance required for date updates
- Countdown timers display meaningful values
- User experience significantly improved

**Verdict:** Perfect solution to the original concern. Professional implementation.

#### 4. TEST-001 (Unit Tests) - ⚠️ DEFERRED (Justified)

**Status:** REASONABLY DEFERRED with proper justification

**Developer's Rationale:**
- Test infrastructure (Vitest + React Testing Library) not installed project-wide
- Setting up testing requires:
  - Installing dev dependencies (@testing-library/react, vitest, jsdom)
  - Configuring vite.config.ts for test environment
  - Setting up test utilities and helpers
  - Establishing testing patterns/conventions
- This is a project-level decision, not story-specific work

**QA Assessment:**
```
✅ Deferral is reasonable - Testing setup is indeed a project-wide task
✅ Properly documented in story Change Log and Completion Notes
✅ Recommendation provided for future sprint
⚠️ Risk acknowledged - Story proceeds with manual testing only
```

**Mitigation:**
- All 4 dashboards render successfully (build passes)
- Manual testing confirms functionality
- Error boundaries now provide failure resilience
- Mock data strategy reduces edge case complexity

**Recommendation for Team:**
Create Story 2.X: "Set Up Frontend Testing Infrastructure" to address:
- Install Vitest + React Testing Library
- Configure test environment
- Write testing guidelines
- Add tests for existing dashboard components retroactively

**Verdict:** Deferral accepted. Not blocking for current story scope.

### Build Verification

```bash
✅ npm run build - SUCCESS
   - 0 TypeScript errors
   - All routes compile successfully
   - Only optimization warnings (expected)

✅ npm run lint - PASS (with expected exceptions)
   - ARIA issues RESOLVED
