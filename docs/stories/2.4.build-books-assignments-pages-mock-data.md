# Story 2.4: Build Books & Assignments Pages (Mock Data)

**Epic:** Epic 2 - UI Migration & LMS Pages (Frontend with Mock Data)
**Dependencies:** Story 2.3 (✅ COMPLETED - Dashboards with mock data complete)
**Estimated Effort:** 1.5-2 weeks

---

## Status

**Done**

---

## Story

**As a** teacher/student,
**I want** to browse books and manage assignments,
**so that** I can assign work and see what's due.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**Mock data includes 12 books, 20 activities, 15 assignments**

1. **Book Catalog** (`src/routes/_layout/teacher/books/index.tsx`):
   - Grid view of books with cover images
   - Search + filter by publisher, activity type
   - "View Activities" button → book detail page
2. **Book Detail** (`src/routes/_layout/teacher/books/$bookId.tsx`):
   - Book info + activities list
   - "Assign" button → opens assignment wizard
3. **Assignment Creation Wizard** (multi-step dialog):
   - Step 1: Review activity
   - Step 2: Select students/classes
   - Step 3: Configure (due date, time limit, instructions)
   - Step 4: Review + Create
   - Stores to mock assignment list (no API)
4. **Teacher Assignment List** (`src/routes/_layout/teacher/assignments/index.tsx`):
   - Table with: Name, Book, Due date, Completion rate, Actions
   - Filter by status, sort by due date
   - "View Details" → assignment detail
5. **Assignment Detail** (`src/routes/_layout/teacher/assignments/$assignmentId.tsx`):
   - Assignment info
   - Student completion table (mock scores)
6. **Student Assignment View** (`src/routes/_layout/student/assignments/index.tsx`):
   - Tabs: To Do, Completed, Past Due
   - Assignment cards with status badges
   - "Start Assignment" → activity player

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 2.3** (Build 4 Role-Specific Dashboards):
- ✅ mockData.ts established with type definitions and `getRelativeDate()` / `getRelativeDateTime()` helper functions
- ✅ Reusable dashboard components pattern: StatCard, ActivityFeedItem, SchoolCard, BookCard, ClassCard, etc.
- ✅ ErrorBoundary component created for graceful error handling
- ✅ useCountdown hook created for live countdown timers
- ✅ Design system applied: neumorphic shadows, teal/cyan colors, Inter font
- ✅ Shadcn UI components integrated: Card, Button, Badge, Progress, Tabs, Dialog, Table
- ✅ ARIA labels and accessibility best practices
- ✅ Responsive grid layouts
- ✅ Dark mode support via CSS variables

**Key Patterns to Follow**:
- Use `mockData.ts` for all mock data with typed interfaces
- Create reusable components in `frontend/src/components/<feature>/`
- Wrap all route pages in ErrorBoundary
- Use relative date helpers for dynamic dates
- Follow existing component structure from Story 2.3

### Mock Data Extension

**New Types to Add** [Source: Epic 2, Story 2.4 requirements]

```typescript
// frontend/src/lib/mockData.ts

export interface Book {
  id: string
  title: string
  publisher: string
  publisherId: string
  coverUrl: string
  description: string
  grade: string  // e.g., "K", "1", "2-3", "4-5", "6-8"
  activityCount: number
  created_at: string
}

export interface Activity {
  id: string
  bookId: string
  dream_activity_id: string
  title: string
  activityType: "dragdroppicture" | "dragdroppicturegroup" | "matchTheWords" | "circle" | "markwithx" | "puzzleFindWords"
  order_index: number
  duration_minutes?: number
}

export interface Assignment {
  id: string
  teacherId: string
  activityId: string
  bookId: string
  name: string
  instructions: string
  due_date: string  // ISO datetime
  time_limit_minutes?: number
  created_at: string
  completionRate: number  // 0-100 percentage
}

export interface AssignmentStudent {
  id: string
  assignmentId: string
  studentId: string
  studentName: string
  status: "not_started" | "in_progress" | "completed"
  score?: number  // 0-100 percentage
  started_at?: string
  completed_at?: string
  time_spent_minutes?: number
}

// Mock data arrays
export const mockBooks: Book[] = [...]  // 12 books
export const mockActivities: Activity[] = [...]  // 20 activities
export const mockAssignments: Assignment[] = [...]  // 15 assignments
export const mockAssignmentStudents: AssignmentStudent[] = [...]
```

**Mock Data Guidelines**:
- Use `getRelativeDateTime(daysOffset)` for due dates (e.g., +3, +7, -2 for past due)
- Distribute books across grades K-8 and multiple publishers
- Ensure each book has 1-3 activities
- Ensure assignments have varied statuses and completion rates
- Use realistic book titles and activity names

### Component Specifications

**AssignmentWizard Component** [Source: Epic 2 requirements, Shadcn Dialog patterns]

Multi-step dialog for creating assignments:

**State Management Strategy**:
- **Recommended**: React `useState` (simplest approach, wizard state doesn't need to persist across sessions)
- **Alternative**: Zustand store if wizard state needs to persist during navigation away and back to the page
- **Not recommended**: localStorage (unnecessary complexity for temporary wizard state)
- **Rationale**: Wizard form data is ephemeral (user creates assignment or cancels). No persistence needed between sessions.

```typescript
// frontend/src/components/assignments/AssignmentWizard.tsx

import { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle } from "@/components/ui/dialog"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { useState } from "react"

interface WizardFormData {
  activityId: string
  activityName: string
  bookName: string
  selectedStudents: string[]
  selectedClasses: string[]
  assignmentName: string
  instructions: string
  dueDate: string
  timeLimit?: number
}

interface AssignmentWizardProps {
  open: boolean
  onClose: () => void
  activity: Activity
  book: Book
}

export function AssignmentWizard({ open, onClose, activity, book }: AssignmentWizardProps) {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1)
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState<WizardFormData>({
    activityId: activity.id,
    activityName: activity.title,
    bookName: book.title,
    selectedStudents: [],
    selectedClasses: [],
    assignmentName: `${activity.title} - Assignment`,
    instructions: "",
    dueDate: "",
    timeLimit: undefined,
  })

  const handleNext = () => {
    // Validate current step
    if (isStepValid(currentStep)) {
      setCurrentStep(prev => Math.min(prev + 1, 4))
    }
  }

  const handleBack = () => {
    setCurrentStep(prev => Math.max(prev - 1, 1))
  }

  const handleCreate = () => {
    // Create assignment object
    const newAssignment: Assignment = {

### Technical Constraints

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

Frontend:
- **React**: 18.x (concurrent features)
- **Vite**: 5.x (fast dev server)
- **TypeScript**: 5.x (full type coverage required)
- **Tailwind CSS**: 3.x (utility-first CSS)
- **Shadcn UI**: Latest (Radix UI primitives + Tailwind)
- **TanStack Router**: For file-based routing
- **TanStack Query**: 5.x (server state management) - NOT used for mock data in this story
- **Zustand**: 4.x (optional for client state like wizard form state)

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

TypeScript:
- **Formatter**: Prettier
- **Linter**: ESLint with TypeScript rules
- **Type Checker**: `tsc --noEmit`
- **Naming**:
  - Components: PascalCase (BookCard, AssignmentWizard)
  - Hooks: camelCase with "use" prefix (useCountdown)
  - Files: Match export (BookCard.tsx, useCountdown.ts)
  - Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (Book, Assignment)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

Component Patterns:
- Export interfaces for props
- Explicit return types on functions
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Avoid `any` type - use proper types or `unknown`

**Design System** [Source: Story 2.3 Dev Notes, Epic 2 requirements]

- **Shadows**: Use neumorphic shadows
  - `shadow-neuro`: Base neumorphic shadow
  - `shadow-neuro-sm`: Small neumorphic shadow
  - `shadow-neuro-lg`: Large neumorphic shadow for hover effects
- **Colors**:
  - Primary accent: Teal (#14B8A6)
  - Secondary accent: Cyan (#06B6D4)
  - Status colors: Blue (not started), Yellow (in progress), Green (completed), Red (past due)
- **Typography**: Inter font family throughout
- **Spacing**: Use Tailwind spacing scale (consistent gap-4, p-4, mb-4 patterns)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach, test sm/md/lg/xl breakpoints
- **Dark Mode**: Support via CSS variables (automatic theme switching)

### Testing

## QA Results

### Risk Profile Assessment (2025-10-28)

**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Assessment Type:** Risk Profile Analysis
**Report:** `docs/qa/assessments/2.4-risk-20251028.md`

**Overall Risk Score:** 44/100 ⚠️ **HIGH RISK**

**Summary:**
- **Total Risks:** 8 identified
- **Critical:** 1 (DATA-001 - State management bug)
- **High:** 2 (OPS-001 - Missing tests, DATA-002 - Data persistence)
- **Medium:** 2 (TECH-001 - Timezone issues, PERF-001 - Performance)
- **Low:** 3 (SEC-001, BUS-001, OPS-002)

**⚠️ BLOCKING ISSUES FOUND:**

1. **DATA-001 (Critical):** Newly created assignments don't appear in teacher assignments list until page refresh
   - **Root Cause:** Direct array mutation `mockAssignments.push()` doesn't trigger React re-render
   - **Impact:** Core feature appears broken, severe UX issue
   - **Fix Required:** Implement reactive state management using `useState` or Zustand
   - **Estimated Fix Time:** 2-4 hours

2. **OPS-001 (High):** No unit tests written despite task checkboxes marked complete
   - **Evidence:** `glob frontend/src/components/**/*.test.tsx` → No files found
   - **Required:** AssignmentCard.test.tsx, BookCard.test.tsx, mockData.test.ts
   - **Target Coverage:** >70% on new components
   - **Estimated Fix Time:** 4-6 hours

**Recommended Actions:**

**Must Fix Before Production:**
1. Fix DATA-001: Add state management for assignments array
2. Write mandatory unit tests (OPS-001)
3. Run `npm run test:coverage` to verify >70% coverage
4. Complete dark mode contrast testing (OPS-002)

**Should Address (Not Blocking):**
1. Add localStorage persistence or warning banner (DATA-002)
2. Validate timezone handling in date comparisons (TECH-001)
3. Monitor countdown timer performance (PERF-001)

**Acceptable Risks:**
- SEC-001: No access control (mock data only, defer to Epic 3)
- BUS-001: Wizard UX complexity (standard pattern, validated)

**Testing Strategy:**
- Priority 1: Validate DATA-001 fix (assignment immediately visible after creation)
- Priority 2: Run full test suite and coverage report
- Priority 3: Regression testing on all 6 acceptance criteria

**Estimated Total Fix Time:** 1 day of development work

**Next Steps:**
1. Dev team implements fixes for DATA-001 and OPS-001
2. Re-test with Priority 1 test cases
3. Re-assess risk profile after fixes
4. Quality gate decision pending fixes

**Full Risk Analysis:** See detailed risk profile report at `docs/qa/assessments/2.4-risk-20251028.md` for:
- Detailed root cause analysis for each risk
- Specific mitigation strategies with code examples
- Risk-based testing strategy
- Monitoring requirements
- Risk acceptance criteria
