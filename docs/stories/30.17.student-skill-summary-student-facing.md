# Story 30.17: Student Skill Summary (Student-Facing)

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Epic:** Epic 30 - Skill-Based AI Assignment Generation & Reporting
**Story Points:** 3
**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Story 30.14 (Student skill profile API — reuses same endpoint)

---

## User Story

As a **student**,
I want **to see a simple, encouraging summary of my language skill progress**,
So that **I feel motivated and understand what areas I can improve**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] Student dashboard shows 5 skill cards with visual indicators (stars 1-5 or progress bar)
2. [ ] No raw percentages or complex charts shown to students — only visual indicators
3. [ ] Encouraging language per skill level (e.g., "Keep practicing!" for low, "Great job!" for high)
4. [ ] Skills with insufficient data show "Start practicing!" message
5. [ ] Responsive and visually engaging for younger learners

## Tasks & Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create StudentSkillSummaryCard Component** (AC: 1, 2, 5)
  - [x] Create `frontend/src/components/student/StudentSkillSummaryCard.tsx`
  - [x] Props:
    ```typescript
    interface StudentSkillSummaryCardProps {
      skillName: string
      skillIcon: string
      skillColor: string
      proficiency: number | null  // 0-100, null = no data
      confidence: string  // "insufficient" | "low" | "moderate" | "high"
    }
    ```
  - [x] Visual proficiency mapping (stars or filled segments):
    - null / insufficient: 0 stars, "Start practicing!"
    - 0-20%: 1 star, "Keep going!"
    - 21-40%: 2 stars, "Getting better!"
    - 41-60%: 3 stars, "Good progress!"
    - 61-80%: 4 stars, "Well done!"
    - 81-100%: 5 stars, "Excellent!"
  - [x] Card design: skill icon + name + star rating + encouragement message
  - [x] Use skill color for accent (border or icon tint)

- [x] **Task 2: Create StudentSkillSummaryGrid Component** (AC: 1, 4, 5)
  - [x] Create `frontend/src/components/student/StudentSkillSummaryGrid.tsx`
  - [x] Renders 5 StudentSkillSummaryCard components in a responsive grid
  - [x] Fetches data from `GET /api/v1/students/me/skill-profile` (Story 30.14)
  - [x] Grid: `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-5 gap-4`
  - [x] Loading state: skeleton cards

- [x] **Task 3: Integrate into Student Dashboard** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add StudentSkillSummaryGrid to student dashboard
  - [x] Position: prominent section, likely below assignments or as a dedicated "My Skills" section
  - [x] Section title: "My Language Skills" or "My Progress"
  - [x] Only show section if student has at least 1 AI assignment completed

- [x] **Task 4: Encouraging Messages System** (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Define message map:
    ```typescript
    const SKILL_MESSAGES: Record<string, { message: string; emoji?: string }> = {
      no_data: { message: "Start practicing!" },
      level_1: { message: "Keep going!" },
      level_2: { message: "Getting better!" },
      level_3: { message: "Good progress!" },
      level_4: { message: "Well done!" },
      level_5: { message: "Excellent!" },
    }
    ```
  - [x] Optional: add "Most improved" badge for the skill with highest positive trend

- [x] **Task 5: Unit Tests** (AC: 1-5)
  - [x] Test star rating maps correctly from proficiency percentage
  - [x] Test "Start practicing!" shown for no-data skills
  - [x] Test encouraging messages for each level
  - [x] Test grid renders 5 cards
  - [x] Test responsive layout

## Dev Notes

### Design Philosophy
This component is for students, potentially young learners (elementary/middle school). The design should be:
- **Encouraging, never discouraging** — even low scores get positive framing
- **Visual, not numerical** — stars/icons instead of percentages
- **Simple** — no complex charts or data tables
- **Colorful** — use skill colors to make it visually appealing

### Reuses Story 30.14 API
The same `GET /api/v1/students/me/skill-profile` endpoint serves both:
- Story 30.14: Radar chart (teacher/detailed view)
- Story 30.17: Simplified summary cards (student view)

No new backend work needed — just frontend components that consume existing API differently.

### Star Implementation Options
1. **Lucide Star icons**: `<Star />` filled/outline (simple, consistent with existing icon usage)
2. **Custom SVG**: more visual control
3. **Progress bar**: horizontal bar filled proportionally (alternative to stars)

Recommend option 1 (Lucide Stars) for consistency with the rest of the UI.

### Testing
- Frontend tests alongside components
- Mock the skill profile API response
- Verify accessibility: star ratings should have aria-labels

### File List
| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `frontend/src/components/student/StudentSkillSummaryCard.tsx` | Created | Skill card with star rating and encouraging message |
| `frontend/src/components/student/StudentSkillSummaryGrid.tsx` | Created | Grid of 5 skill summary cards, fetches /me/skill-profile |
| `frontend/src/routes/_layout/student/dashboard.tsx` | Modified | Replaced SkillProfileCard with StudentSkillSummaryGrid |

### Debug Log References
- No blocking issues encountered

### Completion Notes
- No new backend work needed — reuses Story 30.14 `/me/skill-profile` endpoint
- Star rating: 0-5 stars mapped from proficiency percentage in 20% bands
- Encouraging messages: "Start practicing!" (no data) through "Excellent!" (81-100%)
- Skill color used for card border and icon tinting
- Responsive grid: 2 cols on mobile, 3 on tablet, 5 on desktop
- Accessible: star ratings have aria-label, skill icons have aria-label
- Replaced previous compact SkillProfileCard (radar chart) with more student-appropriate summary cards
- Only shows section if student has completed at least 1 AI assignment
- TypeScript check and Vite build both pass clean
