# Story 1.4: Role-Specific API Endpoints

## Status

**Done**

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** API endpoints for role-specific user creation and management,
**so that** admins can create publishers, publishers can create teachers, and teachers can create students.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Admin endpoints** (`backend/app/api/routes/admin.py`):
   - `POST /api/v1/admin/publishers` - Create publisher user + Publisher record
   - `POST /api/v1/admin/schools` - Create school linked to publisher
   - `GET /api/v1/admin/publishers`, `GET /api/v1/admin/schools`, `GET /api/v1/admin/teachers`, `GET /api/v1/admin/students` - List all with filtering
2. **Publisher endpoints** (`backend/app/api/routes/publishers.py`):
   - `GET /api/v1/publishers/me/schools` - List schools assigned to authenticated publisher
   - `POST /api/v1/publishers/me/teachers` - Create teacher user linked to publisher's school
   - Auto-generate temporary password, return in response
3. **Teacher endpoints** (`backend/app/api/routes/teachers.py`):
   - `POST /api/v1/teachers/me/students` - Create student user
   - `GET /api/v1/teachers/me/students` - List authenticated teacher's students
   - Auto-generate temporary password
4. All endpoints verify role using `require_role()` dependency
5. All endpoints filter data by authenticated user's role-specific ID (publisher_id, teacher_id, etc.)
6. Unit tests verify role-based access control
7. Integration tests verify cross-role access is denied
8. OpenAPI docs updated with role requirements

[Source: docs/stories/1.3.lms-domain-schema-classes-books-activities-assignments.md]

### Tech Stack Context

**Backend Framework:** FastAPI 0.110+ with SQLModel ORM
**Authentication:** JWT with python-jose
**Password Hashing:** passlib with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
**Testing:** pytest with synchronous Session fixtures
**API Docs:** Auto-generated OpenAPI (Swagger UI at /api/v1/docs)

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

### API Architecture Patterns

**URL Structure:** `/api/v1/{resource}`
- Use plural nouns for resources (`/publishers`, `/teachers`, `/students`)
- Use `/me` for authenticated user's own resources (`/publishers/me/schools`)

**HTTP Methods:**
- GET: Retrieve resources
- POST: Create resources
- PUT/PATCH: Update resources
- DELETE: Remove resources

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": { "timestamp": "2025-10-27T..." }
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "Access forbidden. Required roles: ['admin']"
  }
}
```

[Source: docs/architecture/3-api-architecture.md]

### Security & RBAC Implementation

**Role-Based Access Control Already Implemented:**
- `UserRole` enum defined in models.py (admin, publisher, teacher, student)
- `require_role(*allowed_roles: UserRole)` dependency factory in `backend/app/api/deps.py`
- JWT tokens include role in payload

**Usage Pattern:**
```python
from app.api.deps import require_role, SessionDep, CurrentUser
from app.models import UserRole

@router.post("/admin/publishers")
def create_publisher(
    session: SessionDep,
    publisher_in: PublisherCreate,
    current_user: User = Depends(require_role(UserRole.admin))
) -> UserCreationResponse:
    # Only admins can execute this endpoint
    pass
```

**Data Filtering Pattern:**
```python
# Publishers only see their own schools
publisher = session.exec(
    select(Publisher).where(Publisher.user_id == current_user.id)
).first()

schools = session.exec(
    select(School).where(School.publisher_id == publisher.id)
).all()
```

### Project Structure

**Backend Files:**
- Models: `backend/app/models.py`
- Routes: `backend/app/api/routes/{resource}.py` (lowercase, plural)
- API Router: `backend/app/api/main.py` (include routers here)
- Dependencies: `backend/app/api/deps.py` (RBAC already implemented)
- CRUD utilities: `backend/app/crud.py`
- Tests: `backend/app/tests/test_api_{resource}.py`

**Route File Pattern:**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from app.api.deps import require_role, SessionDep
from app.models import UserRole, ...

router = APIRouter(prefix="/publishers", tags=["publishers"])

@router.get("/me/schools")
def list_my_schools(
    session: SessionDep,
    current_user: User = Depends(require_role(UserRole.publisher))
):
    # Implementation
    pass
```

[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

### Database Models Available

**User Management Models (from Story 1.2):**
- `User`: id, email, hashed_password, role, is_active, full_name
- `Publisher`: id, user_id (FK), name, contact_email
- `School`: id, name, publisher_id (FK), address, contact_info
- `Teacher`: id, user_id (FK), school_id (FK), subject_specialization
- `Student`: id, user_id (FK), grade_level, parent_email

**Relationships:**
- User → Publisher (one-to-one)
- User → Teacher (one-to-one)
- User → Student (one-to-one)
- Publisher → Schools (one-to-many)
- School → Teachers (one-to-many)

**LMS Core Models (from Story 1.3):**
- `Class`: id, name, teacher_id (FK), school_id (FK), grade_level, subject, academic_year, is_active
- `ClassStudent`: id, class_id (FK), student_id (FK), enrolled_at

[Source: docs/architecture/2-database-schema-design.md#221-user-management-tables, docs/stories/1.2..., docs/stories/1.3...]

### Password Generation Requirements

**Auto-Generated Temporary Passwords:**
- Use Python's `secrets` module for cryptographic randomness
- Length: 12 characters minimum
- Include: uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters
- Example: `Xy9$mK3nP@wQ`

**Implementation:**
```python
import secrets
import string

def generate_temp_password(length: int = 12) -> str:
    """Generate a secure random password"""
    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "!@#$%^&*"
    return ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(length))
```

**Security Note:** Temp password is returned ONCE in API response, then user must change it on first login (implemented in later story).

[Source: docs/architecture/9-security-architecture.md#94-security-best-practices]

### Coding Standards

**Python Naming:**
- Functions: snake_case (`create_publisher`, `list_my_schools`)
- Classes/Models: PascalCase (`PublisherCreate`, `UserCreationResponse`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH`)

**Type Hints Required:** All function parameters and return types must have type annotations

**FastAPI Route Annotations:**
```python
@router.post(
    "/publishers",
    response_model=UserCreationResponse,
    status_code=201,
    summary="Create new publisher",
    description="Creates publisher user and Publisher record",
    tags=["admin"]
)
```

**Error Handling:**
```python
if not publisher:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
        detail="Publisher not found"
    )

if school.publisher_id != publisher.id:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
        detail="Cannot create teacher in another publisher's school"
    )
```

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing Requirements

**Test Location:** `backend/app/tests/test_api_{resource}.py`

**Test Fixtures Available** (from `conftest.py`):
- `session: Session` - Test database session
- Test users can be created with specific roles for testing

**Test Pattern:**
```python
def test_create_publisher_as_admin(session: Session) -> None:
    """Test admin can create publisher"""
    # Arrange: Create admin user
    admin_user = User(email="admin@test.com", role=UserRole.admin, ...)
    session.add(admin_user)
    session.commit()

    # Act: Create publisher via endpoint (use TestClient)
    # ...

    # Assert: Verify publisher created
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert "temp_password" in response.json()
```

**Role-Based Access Tests:**
- Test positive case (correct role)
- Test negative case (wrong role → 403)
- Test data isolation (user A cannot access user B's data)

**Integration Test Pattern:**
```python
def test_complete_user_creation_flow(session: Session) -> None:
    """Test full hierarchy: Admin → Publisher → Teacher → Student"""
    # 1. Admin creates publisher
    # 2. Publisher creates teacher
    # 3. Teacher creates student
    # 4. Verify all records exist and are linked correctly
```

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Debug Log References

N/A - No significant debug issues. Minor FK constraint fixes were needed in test fixtures.

### Completion Notes List

1. **Pydantic Schema Design**: Added 4 new schemas to models.py:
   - `PublisherCreateAPI`, `TeacherCreateAPI`, `StudentCreateAPI` for API requests
   - `UserCreationResponse` for unified response format with temp_password
   - Fixed forward reference issue by placing UserCreationResponse after all Public classes

2. **Password Generation**: Implemented `generate_temp_password()` in utils.py using secrets module for cryptographic security

3. **CRUD Functions**: Added atomic transaction handlers in crud.py:
   - `create_publisher()`, `create_teacher()`, `create_student()`
   - All use session.flush() + session.commit() pattern for atomicity

4. **Admin Endpoints**: Created admin.py router with 6 endpoints:
   - POST /publishers, POST /schools
   - GET /publishers, GET /schools, GET /teachers, GET /students
   - All properly secured with require_role(UserRole.admin)

5. **Publisher Endpoints**: Created publishers.py router with 2 endpoints:
   - GET /me/schools - Lists publisher's own schools
   - POST /me/teachers - Creates teacher in publisher's school with validation

6. **Teacher Endpoints**: Created teachers.py router with 2 endpoints:
   - POST /me/students - Creates student user
   - GET /me/students - Lists students via JOIN query on ClassStudent

7. **Router Registration**: Updated api/main.py to include admin, publishers, teachers routers

8. **Test Coverage**: 26 new tests across 4 test files:
   - test_api_admin.py: 6 tests
   - test_api_publishers.py: 4 tests
   - test_api_teachers.py: 4 tests

   - Request/response schemas with descriptions
   - Security requirements (OAuth2PasswordBearer)

10. **Fixed Issues**:
    - NameError in UserCreationResponse (moved after Public classes)
    - TypeError with Depends wrapper (require_role already returns Depends)
    - IntegrityError in tests (added proper FK chain: User → Publisher → School)

- [x] Proper data isolation (publisher/teacher data filtering)
- [x] Cryptographically secure password generation
- [x] Atomic transactions for user+role creation
- [x] Duplicate email validation
- [x] OpenAPI documentation

**Optional Future Enhancements (Non-Blocking):**
- [ ] Add inline comment explaining JOIN query logic in `teachers.py:122-128` (low priority)
- [ ] Consider expanding route handler docstrings to match CRUD function detail (low priority)
- [ ] Consider rate limiting middleware if not handled at infrastructure level (medium priority)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for admin list endpoints with large datasets (low priority)

### Security Review

**Status: PASS with Commendation**

Excellent security implementation throughout:

**Authentication:**
- JWT-based authentication properly enforced on all endpoints
- 401 status returned for unauthenticated requests

**Authorization (RBAC):**
- Role-based access control via `require_role()` FastAPI dependency
- Data-level authorization with publisher_id/teacher_id filtering at query level
- Cross-publisher data isolation verified (Publisher A cannot access Publisher B's schools)
- Cross-teacher data isolation verified (Teacher only sees own students)
- 403 Forbidden properly returned for insufficient permissions

**Data Protection:**
- Password hashing with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- Temporary passwords generated using `secrets` module (cryptographically secure)
- Temp passwords appropriately returned in response for one-time delivery
- Duplicate email validation prevents account conflicts

**Input Validation:**
- Pydantic schemas validate all inputs (EmailStr, max_length constraints, UUID validation)
- Foreign key validation (school_id, publisher_id checks)

**Transaction Safety:**
- Atomic user+role creation ensures data consistency
- Proper use of session.flush() + session.commit() pattern
- Automatic rollback on error

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**

Performance design is sound:
- Efficient queries using proper SQLModel select/join patterns
- No N+1 query issues detected
- Pagination implemented with sensible defaults (skip/limit with limit=100)
- Atomic transactions use flush/commit pattern to minimize lock time
- JOIN query in teachers.py is efficient (single query vs N+1)

**Future Monitoring Recommendation:**
Consider adding performance monitoring for admin list endpoints when dealing with large datasets (thousands of records), though current pagination implementation should handle this well.
