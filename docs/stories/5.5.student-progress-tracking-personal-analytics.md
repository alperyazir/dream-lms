## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights (Story 5.4)
[Source: docs/stories/5.4.error-pattern-detection-insights.md#Dev Agent Record]

- Reuse analytics service patterns from `analytics_service.py` (already has student analytics stub)
- Student authorization via ownership verification (match `student_id` from JWT token)
- TanStack Query with 5-minute stale time for frontend caching
- Recharts for visualizations (already used in project)
- Test patterns: Follow 5.4's approach with backend integration + frontend component tests
- Return 404 instead of 403 to prevent information disclosure

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/2-database-schema-design.md#2.2.4]

**assignment_students table (key fields for progress tracking):**
```
- id (UUID, PK)
- assignment_id (UUID, FK)
- student_id (UUID, FK)
- status (ENUM: 'not_started', 'in_progress', 'completed')
- score (INTEGER, 0-100)
- answers_json (JSONB) - Contains student's submitted answers
- started_at (TIMESTAMP)
- completed_at (TIMESTAMP)
- time_spent_minutes (INTEGER)
```

**assignments table:**
```
- id (UUID, PK)
- teacher_id (UUID, FK)
- activity_id (UUID, FK)
- book_id (UUID, FK)
- name (VARCHAR)
- due_date (TIMESTAMP)
```

**activities table:**
```
- id (UUID, PK)
- activity_type (ENUM) - dragdroppicture, matchTheWords, circle, etc.
- title (VARCHAR)
```

**feedback table (for achievements):**
```
- id (UUID, PK)
- assignment_student_id (UUID, FK)
- badges (TEXT[]) - Array of badge names
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### Analytics Engine Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/7-analytics-engine.md#7.1]

Existing student analytics stub:
```python
async def get_student_analytics(student_id: UUID, period: str):
    """Calculate student performance metrics"""
    query = select(
        func.avg(AssignmentStudent.score).label('avg_score'),
        func.count(AssignmentStudent.id).label('total_completed'),
        func.sum(AssignmentStudent.time_spent_minutes).label('total_time')
    ).where(
        AssignmentStudent.student_id == student_id,
        AssignmentStudent.status == 'completed',
        AssignmentStudent.completed_at >= get_period_start(period)
    )
```

**Period Filtering:**
- `this_week`: completed_at >= start of current week (Monday)
- `this_month`: completed_at >= first day of current month
- `all_time`: no date filter

**Streak Calculation:**
- Count consecutive days with at least one completed assignment
- Break on any day without completion
- Example: Completed on Mon, Tue, Wed = 3-day streak

**Improvement Trend Calculation:**
- Compare last 7 days avg score vs previous 7 days avg score
- IMPROVING: recent avg >= previous avg + 5%
- STABLE: difference < 5%
- DECLINING: recent avg < previous avg - 5%

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/3-api-architecture.md#3.4.6]

**Endpoint to implement:**
```
GET /api/v1/students/me/progress?period=this_month
```

**Response format:**
```json

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Backend: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLModel, PostgreSQL with JSONB
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript 5.x, TanStack Query 5.x, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS
- Testing: pytest (backend), Vitest + RTL (frontend)
- Charts: Recharts 2.x for data visualization

### Student-Friendly UI Guidelines (AC: 10, 11)

**Encouraging Messages by Trend:**
- IMPROVING: "You're on a roll! Keep up the great work!" (with up arrow, green)
- STABLE: "Steady progress! You're doing well!" (with level arrow, blue)
- DECLINING: "Every expert was once a beginner. Keep practicing!" (with encouraging icon, yellow)

**Activity Type Labels (User-Friendly):**
| Technical Name | Friendly Label | Icon |
|---------------|----------------|------|
| dragdroppicture | Drag & Drop | 🎯 |
| dragdroppicturegroup | Group Sorting | 📦 |
| matchTheWords | Word Matching | 🔗 |
| circle | Circle the Answer | ⭕ |
| markwithx | Mark with X | ❌ |
| puzzleFindWords | Word Search | 🔍 |

**Color Scheme:**
- Score 90-100: Green (#22c55e) - "Excellent!"
- Score 70-89: Blue (#3b82f6) - "Great job!"
- Score 50-69: Yellow/Amber (#f59e0b) - "Keep practicing!"
- Score 0-49: Orange (#f97316) - "You'll get it next time!"

**Achievement Badge Types (Suggested):**
- `perfect_score` - Score 100% on any assignment
- `streak_7` - 7-day completion streak
- `streak_30` - 30-day completion streak
- `fast_learner` - Complete assignment under average time with score > 80%
- `first_complete` - Complete first assignment
- `ten_complete` - Complete 10 assignments
- `activity_master` - Score > 90% on all activity types at least once

### Mobile Responsive Design (AC: 14)

Layout priorities for mobile:
1. Stats card (full width)
2. Progress chart (full width, scrollable)
3. Recent assignments (list view)
4. Activity breakdown (horizontal scroll or accordion)
5. Achievements (horizontal scroll badges)
6. Study time (compact card)
7. Tips (collapsible section)

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Backend: `backend/app/tests/test_api/test_student_progress.py`
- Frontend Hook: `frontend/src/hooks/useStudentProgress.test.tsx`
- Frontend Components: `frontend/src/components/progress/__tests__/`

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/10-testing-strategy.md, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#Testing Patterns]

**Backend:**
- Use pytest with async fixtures
- Create fixtures for student token, sample assignments with various states
- Test each calculation individually (stats, streak, trend, etc.)
- Test authorization (own data only)
- Test edge cases (empty, no scores, all 100%)
- Test date range filtering

**Frontend:**
- Use Vitest + React Testing Library
- Test hook with QueryClientProvider wrapper
- Test components with mock data for all states
- Test responsive behavior (viewport sizes)
- Test encouraging messaging based on scores
- Test empty/loading/error states

### Test Coverage Expectations
- Backend: 10-12 integration tests covering all ACs
- Frontend: 25-35 tests (8-10 hook tests, 20-25 component tests)
